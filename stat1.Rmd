### 1. Introduction
<br>
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) leverages customer data to design strategies that improve decision-making and customer satisfaction. This project focuses on using Association Rule Discovery to uncover valuable insights such as Target Marketing, Churn Analysis, and Sales Forecasting.
<br><br><br>

### 2. Goal
<br>
This project aims to analyze bank customer data to uncover relationships between financial services using Association Rule Discovery and Path Analysis. The insights will support personalized product recommendations, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Case 1: Customer Subscription Patterns in Banking Services**
<br><br><br>
<h4>1-1. Research Subject</h4>
<br>
This analysis aims to identify the types of financial services that bank customers frequently subscribe to together.

- Dataset: BNKSERV  
- ACCT: Unique customer ID  
- SERVICE: Subscribed financial services  

The dataset includes 13 types of services offered, as detailed in the appendix.

<br><br>
<h4>1-2. Association Rule Discovery</h4>
<br>
The BNKSERV dataset was analyzed using Association Analysis, Graph Exploration, and Market Basket Analysis nodes.
<br>
In the Graph Exploration results:

- Each customerâ€™s (ACCT) subscribed services are identified.  
- Among the services, CKING (Checking Account) had the highest subscription frequency, with a total of 6,855 occurrences.

### 4. Methodology & Summary

  + LASSO regressions showed the best performance with a cross validation RMSE-score of 0.1121. Although there is a lot of multicollinearity among the variables, LASSO regression include feature selection; it does not select a substantial number of the available variables in its model, as it is supposed to do.
  + The XGBoost model also performs very well with a cross validation RMSE of 0.1162.
  + As those two algorithms are very different, averaging predictions is likely to improve the predictions. As the Lasso cross validated RMSE is better than XGBoost's CV score, I decided to weight the Lasso results double.

### 6. Conclusion

In this project, we successfully analyzed the engagement patterns of the "National Geographic" Facebook page through various text mining techniques. Key findings indicate a strong focus on wildlife photography and conservation. 
Future improvements could involve sentiment analysis to determine audience reactions and further investigation into time-based engagement trends.
