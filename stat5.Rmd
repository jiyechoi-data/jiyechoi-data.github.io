<br><br><br>

### 1. Introduction
<br>
Understanding the relationship between living expenses and savings is crucial in today's economy for effective financial planning. This project investigates how various factors such as employment status and educational expenses for children influence monthly living expenses. Leveraging latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) and path analysis, the study uncovers patterns and relationships to provide insights into economic behaviors.
<br><br><br>

### 2. Goal
<br>
The primary goal of this study is to analyze how monthly living expenses evolve over time and to determine whether factors like employment status, educational expenses for children, and savings significantly impact these changes. Additionally, the study aims to evaluate how missing data treatment methods, such as regression imputation and full information maximum likelihood (FIML), affect the analysis results.



<br><br>

### 3. Data and Variables
<br>
This project uses data from the Korean Longitudinal Survey of Women & Families (KLoWF), encompassing responses from 9,068 households over three years (2011–2013). The panel dataset allows for tracking changes over time and assessing individual-level variations in living expenses. <br>
<br>
The dataset includes information on various financial and demographic factors, with a focus on the following variables:
<br>

- **Monthly Living Expenses**: Average monthly household expenses in 10,000 Korean Won (KRW). <br>
- **Savings**: Total monthly savings, including deposits, savings-type insurance, and pensions, expressed in 10,000 KRW. <br>
- **Employment Status**: A binary variable indicating whether the household head is employed (Yes/No). <br>
- **Educational Expenses**: Monthly spending on children’s education, including childcare and extracurricular activities, expressed in 10,000 KRW.


<br><br>

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
<br>

Below are the descriptive statistics and frequency analysis results from SPSS:
<br><br><br>



| Variable               |  Year  |  Mean (KRW)  | Standard Deviation (KRW)|
|------------------------|--------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Monthly Living Expenses|  2011  |   178.75     |          50.30          |
|                        |  2012  |   191.31     |          55.12          |
|                        |  2013  |   205.15     |          60.45          |
|                        |        |              |                         |
<br>

- Average monthly living expenses show a clear upward trend over the three years. <br>
- The increasing standard deviation highlights growing variability in expenses, indicating widening differences in household spending patterns. This could reflect changes in income distribution or spending habits among households.
<br><br><br><br>



| Variable              | Category             | Frequency (%) |
|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Employment Status     | Employed             | 82.4          |
|                       | Unemployed           | 17.6          |
|                       |                      |               |
<br>

- A significant majority of households (82.4%) have an employed head of household, suggesting financial stability through employment.
- A smaller portion (17.6%) of households have an unemployed head of household, indicating potential financial challenges for these households.

<br><br><br><br>


| Savings Category   | Frequency | Percentage (%) | Cumulative Percentage (%) |
|--------------------|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 1-100              | 4285     | 47.3            | 47.3                      |
| 101-200            | 4192     | 46.2            | 93.5                      |
| 201-300            | 455      | 5.0             | 98.5                      |
| 301-400            | 89       | 1.0             | 99.5                      |
| 401-1500           | 28       | 0.3             | 99.8                      |
| Total              | 9068     | 100.0           | 100.0                     |
<br>

- The largest percentage of households (47.3%) have savings in the 1-100 (10,000 KRW) range, followed by 46.2% in the 101-200 KRW range.
- Very few households save above 300 (10,000 KRW), with only 1% saving in the 301-400 (10,000 KRW) range.
- The Cumulative Percentage column shows that over 93% of households have savings of 200 (10,000 KRW) or less, suggesting a concentration in lower savings categories.

<br><br><br><br>


| Educational Expenses Category | Frequency (%) |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| 1-50 (10,000 KRW)              | 85.6          |
| 51-100 (10,000 KRW)            | 12.0          |
| 101-150 (10,000 KRW)           | 1.8           |
| 151-200 (10,000 KRW)           | 0.5           |
| 201+ (10,000 KRW)              | 0.2           |
| Total                          | 100.0         |

<br>

- The majority of households (85.6%) spend between 1-50 (10,000 KRW) on educational expenses.
- 12.0% of households spend between 51-100 (10,000 KRW), while only 0.2% spend more than 2M KRW.
- The cumulative percentage shows that 99.5% of households have educational expenses below 2M KRW.

<br><br>

To investigate how monthly living expenses change over time, we will address missing data using two imputation methods: **Regression Imputation** and **Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML)**. Following this, we will apply **Latent Growth Curve Modeling (LGCM)** to analyze the data.


<br><br><br>

### 5. Analysis

<br><br>
<h4> 1-1. Path Analysis </h4>
<br>
Missing data were handled using Regression Imputation prior to conducting path analysis.
<br>
Path analysis will be conducted to examine the causal relationships between Employment Status, Educational Expenses, Average Monthly Savings, and Living Expenses, specifically to understand how Employment Status and Educational Expenses influence Living Expenses.

<br><br><br><br>

<!-- path analysis1 -->

<p align="center" style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">
  [Fig. Path Diagram of the Research Model]
    <br>
</p>
<br><br>

This research model assumes that Employment Status influences Private Education Expenses, Monthly Savings, and Living Expenses. It also assumes that Private Education Expenses impact Monthly Savings and Living Expenses, and that Monthly Savings influence Living Expenses.

<br><br>
Model Fit Evaluation (Default Model)
<br>

- Number of distinct sample moments: 14
- Number of distinct parameters to be estimated: 14
- Degrees of freedom: 0 (calculated as 14 - 14)

<br>

Results

- Chi-Square: 0.000
- Degrees of Freedom: 0
- Minimum Achieved
- Probability level cannot be computed

<br><br>

The results show \( \chi^2 = 0 \) and \( df = 0 \). When \( \chi^2 = 0 \), it indicates a perfect fit between the research model and the data, meaning there is no difference between the observed values and the predicted values. The \( df = 0 \) implies that the number of parameters to be estimated is equal to the number of data points, which typically occurs in highly constrained models.

This type of model is considered **over-identified** and is the most constrained form of the model, providing the highest degree of fit but lacking flexibility. Because of this, such models are overly simplistic and cannot capture the complexity of the relationships between variables. Therefore, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn from this model due to its lack of complexity and capacity to represent real-world data.

<br><br><br>

**Path: Employment → Savings**
<br><br>

- Total Effect: -13.497
- Direct Effect: -9.622
- Indirect Effect: -3.876

<br><br>
The relationship can be broken down as follows:
\[
\text{Total Effect} (-13.497) = \text{Direct Effect} (-9.622) + \text{Indirect Effect} (-3.876)
\]

<br>
The Indirect Effect of -3.876 is calculated as:
\[
\text{Indirect Effect} (-3.876) = \text{Path Coefficient} (\text{Employment → Private Education}) (-14.655) \times \text{Path Coefficient} (\text{Private Education → Savings}) (0.264)
\]
<br><br>

---

<br><br>
**Path: Employment → Living Expenses**

<br>

- Total Effect: -64.762
- Direct Effect: -37.592
- Indirect Effect: -27.171

<br><br>
The relationship can be broken down as follows:
\[
\text{Total Effect} (-64.762) = \text{Direct Effect} (-37.592) + \text{Indirect Effect} (-27.171)
\]

<br>
The Indirect Effect of -27.171 is further decomposed into the following pathways:<br>

1. Employment → Savings → Living Expenses <br>
2. Employment → Private Education → Savings → Living Expenses <br>
3. Employment → Private Education → Living Expenses
<br><br><br><br>

- The **Indirect Effect** highlights the mediating roles of **Private Education** and **Savings** in the impact of **Employment** on **Living Expenses**.

- The decomposition provides insights into the complex pathways that influence the dependent variable.

<br><br>



<br><br><br><br>

**Direct Effect Significance**

<br>
The significance of the direct effects is as follows:
<br>

| Path                          | Estimate  | S.E.  | C.R.   | p-value  | Significance |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Private Education ← Employment| -14.655   | 0.948 | -15.464| ***      | Significant  |
| Savings ← Employment          | -9.622    | 2.060 | -4.694 | ***      | Significant  |
| Savings ← Private Education   | 0.265     | 0.013 | 19.961 | ***      | Significant  |
| Living Expenses ← Savings     | -37.592   | 2.603 | -14.446| ***      | Significant  |
| Living Expenses ← Private Education | 1.610| 0.029 | 56.194 | ***      | Significant  |


<br><br>

- The path **Private Education ← Employment** has a significant direct effect with a negative coefficient of **-14.655**, indicating that Employment negatively influences Private Education.

- The path **Savings ← Employment** also shows a significant negative direct effect of **-9.622**.

- All direct effects have p-values less than **0.001 (***), indicating high statistical significance.

<br><br><br>

**Indirect Effect Significance**

<br>

- The \( p \)-values for all indirect effects were \( p = 0.010 \), which is statistically significant at \( \alpha = 0.05 \).
- This confirms that the indirect effects in the model are significant and meaningful.

| Default model          | 6                 | 32.272  | 3    | 0.000   | 10.757  |
| Saturated model        | 9                 | 0.000   | 0    | -       | -       |
| Independence model     | 3                 | 12280.110| 6    | 0.000   | 2046.685|

<br><br>

- The default model's Chi-square statistic (\( \chi^2 = 32.272 \)) with **df = 3** and **p-value = 0.000** indicates a poor fit to the data.

- The **CMIN/DF value of 10.757** exceeds the acceptable threshold (typically \( < 5 \)), further supporting that the model does not fit well.
- Compared to the independence model (\( \text{CMIN/DF} = 2046.685 \)), the default model shows a relatively better fit but is still inadequate overall.

Model Estimation without Variance Constraints on Error Terms
<br><br><br>
Null and Alternative Hypotheses for ICEPT and SLOPE:
<br><br>

- **Null hypothesis (H₀):**
  - ICEPT = 0
  - SLOPE = 0
<br>
- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):**
  - ICEPT ≠ 0
  - SLOPE ≠ 0

<br><br>

| Variable | Estimate  | SE     | CR      | p-value |

| ICEPT    | 178.688   | 1.072  | 166.652 | ***     |
| SLOPE    | 27.600    | 1.009  | 27.364  | ***     |

<br>

- The mean estimate for ICEPT (intercept) is 178.688, representing the initial level of monthly living expenses in 2011.  
- The mean estimate for SLOPE (rate of change) is 27.600, indicating an annual increase in monthly living expenses.  
- Both ICEPT and SLOPE are statistically significant (p < 0.001).

<br><br>

| Variable | Variance  | SE     | CR      | p-value |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| ICEPT    | 8340.195  | 194.100| 42.968  | ***     |
| SLOPE    | 2245.592  | 326.040| 6.887   | ***     |

<br>

- The variance for ICEPT is 8340.195, indicating variability in initial levels of monthly living expenses across households.
- The variance for SLOPE is 2245.592, reflecting differences in the rate of change in expenses.
- Both variances are statistically significant (p < 0.001), suggesting meaningful individual-level variability.

<br><br>

The variance estimates for ICEPT and SLOPE are 8340.195 and 2245.592, respectively. Based on the p-value, the variance is statistically significant, indicating meaningful individual differences in the initial levels and rates of change in monthly living expenses. This means that there is variability in both the starting point (initial level) and the change rate of monthly living expenses among individuals.

<br>
Using these results, the average monthly living expenses over three years can be calculated as follows:
<br><br>

\[
\text{2011 Monthly Living Expenses} = 178.688 + 0.000 \times 27.600 = 178.688
\]

\[
\text{2012 Monthly Living Expenses} = 178.688 + 0.5 \times 27.600 = 192.488
\]

\[
\text{2013 Monthly Living Expenses} = 178.688 + 1.0 \times 27.600 = 206.288
\]

**Implied Mean**

<br>

| Year  | Implied Mean (Monthly Living Expenses) |
|-------|---------------------------------------|
| 2011  | 178.688                               |
| 2012  | 192.488                               |
| 2013  | 206.287                               |

<br>

Using these implied means, the average monthly living expenses for 2014 can be predicted as:
<br><br>

\[
\text{2014 Monthly Living Expenses} = 178.688 + 1.5 \times 27.600 = 220.088
\]

<br><br><br>

A model was created to examine whether the pattern of changes in monthly living expenses differs based on the level of savings.
