<br><br><br>

### 1. Introduction
<br>
Understanding the relationship between living expenses and savings is crucial in today's economy for effective financial planning. This project investigates how various factors such as employment status and educational expenses for children influence monthly living expenses. Leveraging latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) and path analysis, the study uncovers patterns and relationships to provide insights into economic behaviors.
<br><br><br>

### 2. Goal
<br>
The primary goal of this study is to analyze how monthly living expenses evolve over time and to determine whether factors like employment status, educational expenses for children, and savings significantly impact these changes. Additionally, the study aims to evaluate how missing data treatment methods, such as regression imputation and full information maximum likelihood (FIML), affect the analysis results.



<br><br>

### 3. Data and Variables
<br>
This project uses data from the Korean Longitudinal Survey of Women & Families (KLoWF), encompassing responses from 9,068 households over three years (2011–2013). The panel dataset allows for tracking changes over time and assessing individual-level variations in living expenses. <br>
<br>
The dataset includes information on various financial and demographic factors, with a focus on the following variables:
<br>

- **Monthly Living Expenses**: Average monthly household expenses in 10,000 Korean Won (KRW). <br>
- **Savings**: Total monthly savings, including deposits, savings-type insurance, and pensions, expressed in 10,000 KRW. <br>
- **Employment Status**: A binary variable indicating whether the household head is employed (Yes/No). <br>
- **Educational Expenses**: Monthly spending on children’s education, including childcare and extracurricular activities, expressed in 10,000 KRW.


<br><br>

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
<br>

Below are the descriptive statistics and frequency analysis results from SPSS:
<br><br><br>



| Variable               |  Year  |  Mean (KRW)  | Standard Deviation (KRW)|
|------------------------|--------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Monthly Living Expenses|  2011  |   178.75     |          50.30          |
|                        |  2012  |   191.31     |          55.12          |
|                        |  2013  |   205.15     |          60.45          |
|                        |        |              |                         |
<br>

- Average monthly living expenses show a clear upward trend over the three years. <br>
- The increasing standard deviation highlights growing variability in expenses, indicating widening differences in household spending patterns. This could reflect changes in income distribution or spending habits among households.
<br><br><br><br>



| Variable              | Category             | Frequency (%) |
|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Employment Status     | Employed             | 82.4          |
|                       | Unemployed           | 17.6          |
|                       |                      |               |
<br>

- A significant majority of households (82.4%) have an employed head of household, suggesting financial stability through employment.
- A smaller portion (17.6%) of households have an unemployed head of household, indicating potential financial challenges for these households.

<br><br><br><br>


| Savings Category   | Frequency | Percentage (%) | Cumulative Percentage (%) |
|--------------------|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 1-100              | 4285     | 47.3            | 47.3                      |
| 101-200            | 4192     | 46.2            | 93.5                      |
| 201-300            | 455      | 5.0             | 98.5                      |
| 301-400            | 89       | 1.0             | 99.5                      |
| 401-1500           | 28       | 0.3             | 99.8                      |
| Total              | 9068     | 100.0           | 100.0                     |
<br>

- The largest percentage of households (47.3%) have savings in the 1-100 (10,000 KRW) range, followed by 46.2% in the 101-200 KRW range.
- Very few households save above 300 (10,000 KRW), with only 1% saving in the 301-400 (10,000 KRW) range.
- The Cumulative Percentage column shows that over 93% of households have savings of 200 (10,000 KRW) or less, suggesting a concentration in lower savings categories.

<br><br><br><br>


| Educational Expenses Category | Frequency (%) |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| 1-50 (10,000 KRW)              | 85.6          |
| 51-100 (10,000 KRW)            | 12.0          |
| 101-150 (10,000 KRW)           | 1.8           |
| 151-200 (10,000 KRW)           | 0.5           |
| 201+ (10,000 KRW)              | 0.2           |
| Total                          | 100.0         |

<br>

- The majority of households (85.6%) spend between 1-50 (10,000 KRW) on educational expenses.
- 12.0% of households spend between 51-100 (10,000 KRW), while only 0.2% spend more than 2M KRW.
- The cumulative percentage shows that 99.5% of households have educational expenses below 2M KRW.

<br><br>

To investigate how monthly living expenses change over time, we will address missing data using two imputation methods and then apply **Latent Growth Curve Modeling (LGCM)** to analyze the data.


<br><br><br>

### 5. Method 1: Regression Imputation

<br><br>
<h4> 1-1. Path Analysis </h4>
<br>

Path analysis will be conducted to examine the causal relationships between Employment Status, Educational Expenses, Average Monthly Savings, and Living Expenses, specifically to understand how Employment Status and Educational Expenses influence Living Expenses.

<br><br><br><br>

<!-- path analysis1 -->

<p align="center" style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">
  [Fig. Path Diagram of the Research Model]
    <br>
</p>
<br><br>

This research model assumes that Employment Status influences Private Education Expenses, Monthly Savings, and Living Expenses. It also assumes that Private Education Expenses impact Monthly Savings and Living Expenses, and that Monthly Savings influence Living Expenses.

<br><br>
Model Fit Evaluation (Default Model)
<br>

- Number of distinct sample moments: 14
- Number of distinct parameters to be estimated: 14
- Degrees of freedom: 0 (calculated as 14 - 14)

<br>

Results:

- Chi-Square: 0.000
- Degrees of Freedom: 0
- Minimum Achieved
- Probability level cannot be computed

<br><br>

The results show \( \chi^2 = 0 \) and \( df = 0 \). When \( \chi^2 = 0 \), it indicates a perfect fit between the research model and the data, meaning there is no difference between the observed values and the predicted values. The \( df = 0 \) implies that the number of parameters to be estimated is equal to the number of data points, which typically occurs in highly constrained models.

This type of model is considered **over-identified** and is the most constrained form of the model, providing the highest degree of fit but lacking flexibility. Because of this, such models are overly simplistic and cannot capture the complexity of the relationships between variables. Therefore, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn from this model due to its lack of complexity and capacity to represent real-world data.
