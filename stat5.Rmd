<br><br><br>

### 1. Introduction
<br>
Understanding the relationship between living expenses and savings is crucial for effective financial planning. <br> This study aims to analyze how monthly living expenses evolve over time and to determine whether factors such as employment status, educational expenses for children, and savings significantly impact these changes. <br> Using SPSS for data preprocessing and AMOS for latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) and path analysis, the study also evaluates the effects of missing data treatment methods, including regression imputation and full information maximum likelihood (FIML), to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships in economic behaviors.
<br><br><br><br>


### 2. Analysis

<br><br>
<h4> 1-1. Exploratory Data Analysis </h4>
<br>
This study utilizes data from the Korean Longitudinal Survey of Women and Families (KLoWF), focusing on the following key variables (measured in units of 10,000 Korean Won, KRW):


<br>

- **Monthly Living Expenses**: Household expenses reported on a monthly basis.<br>
- **Savings**: Total monthly savings, including deposits, insurance, and pensions.<br>
- **Employment Status**: Binary variable indicating whether the household head is employed. <br>
- **Educational Expenses**: Monthly spending on children’s education, including extracurricular activities.

<br>

This study analyzed the monthly living expenses, savings, and educational expenses of households to uncover significant patterns and trends. 

<br><br><br>
Below is a summary of the key findings and descriptive statistics:
<br><br>

| Total                                  | 100.0    |

<br>

- The majority of households (85.6%) spent between 1–50 (10,000 KRW) on educational expenses, indicating relatively low expenditure in this category.
- Only 0.2% of households reported spending more than 2 million KRW on education, highlighting its rarity.

<br><br><br><br>

To investigate how monthly living expenses change over time, we will address missing data using two imputation methods: **Regression Imputation** and **Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML)**. <br> Following this, we will apply Latent Growth Curve Modeling (LGCM) to analyze the data.


<br><br><br><br>


<h4> 1-2. Path Analysis </h4>
<br>
This study examines the causal relationships between Employment Status, Educational Expenses, Savings, and Living Expenses using path analysis. Missing data were handled using **Regression Imputation**.

|-------------------------|---------------|
| Chi-square (\( \chi^2 \))| 32.272        |
| Degrees of Freedom (df)  | 3             |
| p-value                 | 0.000         |
| CMIN/DF                 | 10.757        |


<br><br>

- The Default Model's fit (\( \chi^2 = 32.272, p < 0.001 \)) indicates a poor fit, as CMIN/DF exceeds the acceptable threshold of 5.
- Adjustments to the model, such as removing constraints on error variances, improved the fit significantly.

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br>

Model Fit Results
<br>

| Metric                  | Default Model |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Chi-square (\( \chi^2 \))| 0.107         |
| Degrees of Freedom (df)  | 1             |
| p-value                 | 0.744         |
| CMIN/DF                 | 0.107         |
<br>

- After removing constraints on error variances, the model showed excellent fit (\( \chi^2 = 0.107, p = 0.744 \)).
- The RMSEA value of 0.000 further confirms the model's adequacy.


<br><br><br><br><br>
**Parameter Estimates**
<br><br>

| Parameter | Estimate  | SE     | CR     | p-value |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| ICEPT     | 178.688   | 1.072  | 166.652| ***     |
| SLOPE     | 27.600    | 1.009  | 27.364 | ***     |

<br>

- The initial level of monthly living expenses (ICEPT) was 178.688, representing the 2011 average.
- The annual rate of change (SLOPE) was 27.600, indicating a statistically significant increase over time (\( p < 0.001 \)).

<br><br>

| Parameter | Variance  | SE     | CR     | p-value |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| ICEPT     | 8340.195  | 194.100| 42.968 | ***     |
| SLOPE     | 2245.592  | 326.040| 6.887  | ***     |

<br>

- Significant variability exists in both initial levels (\( \text{Var}(\text{ICEPT}) = 8340.195 \)) and rates of change (\( \text{Var}(\text{SLOPE}) = 2245.592 \)).
- This highlights individual differences in spending behavior.


<br><br><br>


Using these results, the average monthly living expenses over three years can be calculated as follows:
<br><br>

\[
\text{2011 Monthly Living Expenses} = 178.688 + 0.000 \times 27.600 = 178.688
\]

\[
\text{2012 Monthly Living Expenses} = 178.688 + 0.5 \times 27.600 = 192.488
\]

\[
\text{2013 Monthly Living Expenses} = 178.688 + 1.0 \times 27.600 = 206.288
\]

<br><br><br>

**Implied Mean**

<br><br>

| Year  | Implied Mean (Monthly Living Expenses) |
|-------|---------------------------------------|
| 2011  | 178.688                               |
| 2012  | 192.488                               |
| 2013  | 206.287                               |

<br>

Using these implied means, the average monthly living expenses for 2014 can be predicted as:
<br><br>

\[
\text{2014 Monthly Living Expenses} = 178.688 + 1.5 \times 27.600 = 220.088
\]

<br><br><br>

A model was created to examine whether the pattern of changes in monthly living expenses differs based on the level of savings.

|---------------------|----------|
| Chi-square (\( \chi^2 \)) | 0.133    |
| Degrees of Freedom (df) | 2        |
| p-value            | 0.936    |
| CMIN/DF            | 0.067    |
| RMSEA              | 0.000    |


<br>

- The model demonstrated excellent fit (\( \chi^2 = 0.133, p = 0.936 \)).
- The RMSEA value of 0.000 further supports the model's adequacy.

<br><br><br><br><br>

**Parameter Estimates**
<br><br><br>

| Dependent Variable | Predictor   | Estimate | S.E.  | C.R.   | P      |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| ICEPT             | Savings     | 0.399    | 0.018 | 21.683 | <0.001 |
| SLOPE             | Savings     | 0.027    | 0.018 | 1.467  | 0.142  |

<br>

- The path coefficient from Savings to ICEPT (0.399) indicates a statistically significant positive influence on the initial level of monthly living expenses (\( p < 0.001 \)).
- The path coefficient from Savings to SLOPE (0.027) is not statistically significant (\( p = 0.142 \)).

<br>
Interpretation
<br>

- Savings significantly impact the initial level of living expenses (ICEPT), but there is no significant effect on the rate of change (SLOPE).
- While savings are associated with differences in initial living expenses, they do not explain differences in how living expenses change over time.

<br><br><br>

To handle missing data, **Regression Imputation** was utilized. This method ensures that missing values are estimated based on observed data, providing a reliable foundation for subsequent analyses.

<br><br><br>
