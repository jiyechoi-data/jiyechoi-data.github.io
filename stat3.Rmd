### 1. Introduction
<br>
Time series analysis is a powerful tool for understanding trends, patterns, and relationships in sequential data. <br>
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between the number of monthly foreign tourists visiting Jeju Island and the corresponding tourism revenue. By leveraging advanced time series modeling techniques, we aim to provide meaningful insights into the dynamics of tourism and its economic impact. 
<br><br><br>

### 2. Goal
<br>
This project aims to predict monthly tourism revenue based on the number of foreign visitors to Jeju Island using Transfer Function Models and ARIMA modeling. By identifying and quantifying the relationship between these variables, the analysis provides actionable insights to support strategic decision-making in the tourism sector.

### 3. Methodology & Summary

  + LASSO regressions showed the best performance with a cross validation RMSE-score of 0.1121. Although there is a lot of multicollinearity among the variables, LASSO regression include feature selection; it does not select a substantial number of the available variables in its model, as it is supposed to do.
  + The XGBoost model also performs very well with a cross validation RMSE of 0.1162.
  + As those two algorithms are very different, averaging predictions is likely to improve the predictions. As the Lasso cross validated RMSE is better than XGBoost's CV score, I decided to weight the Lasso results double.
